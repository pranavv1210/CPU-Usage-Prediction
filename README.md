## CPU Usage Prediction using Machine Learning üíª

### üìù Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict **CPU usage** based on a set of independent variables related to a computing pod's resource requests and runtime. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately forecast CPU consumption, which is critical for resource management and cost optimization in cloud computing environments.

This repository is structured to demonstrate a reproducible machine learning workflow using **Git** for code versioning and **DVC (Data Version Control)** for data and model versioning.

-----

### üìÅ Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following key files:

  * `data-1754297123597.csv`: The raw dataset used for training and evaluation.
  * `train_model.py`: The core Python script that handles data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
  * `dvc.yaml`: The DVC pipeline file that defines the entire machine learning workflow.
  * `dvc.lock`: A lock file automatically generated by DVC, which records the exact state of the data and code to ensure reproducibility.
  * `metrics.json`: A JSON file containing the model's performance metrics, saved after training.
  * `model.joblib`: The serialized, trained machine learning model.
  * `.gitignore`: Tells Git to ignore large files and folders (like the `data` and `model` directories) to keep the repository small.
  * `.dvcignore`: Tells DVC to ignore specific files.

### üöÄ Getting Started

To reproduce this project, follow these steps.

-----

#### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have **Git** and **Python** installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

-----

#### **Installation**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pranavv1210/CPU-Usage-Prediction.git
    cd CPU-Usage-Prediction
    ```
2.  Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn dvc joblib
    ```

-----

#### **Running the Experiment**

This project uses a DVC pipeline to ensure the entire workflow is reproducible.

1.  **Initialize DVC:**
    ```bash
    python -m dvc init
    ```
2.  **Restore the Dataset:** Since the dataset is versioned with DVC, you need to pull it from the DVC cache.
    ```bash
    python -m dvc pull
    ```
3.  **Reproduce the Pipeline:** This single command will run the entire experiment‚Äîfrom data processing to model training and evaluation.
    ```bash
    python -m dvc repro
    ```
    This command will execute `train_model.py` and save the trained model and metrics.

### üìä Model Performance

The performance of the trained **Random Forest Regressor** model is logged in `metrics.json`. You can view it directly in your terminal using DVC.

```bash
python -m dvc metrics show
```

The key metrics are:

  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** `0.00069`
  * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** `0.02618`
  * **R-squared ($R^2$):** `0.83211`

The high $R^2$ score indicates that the model is highly effective at explaining the variance in CPU usage.

### üìà Model Visualizations

This section includes visualizations that provide a deeper understanding of the model's performance and the data itself. The images are linked directly from the repository.

#### 1\. Predicted vs. Actual CPU Usage

This scatter plot shows the model's predictions against the actual values. A tight cluster of points around the diagonal line of "perfect prediction" demonstrates the model's high accuracy and strong fit to the data.

#### 2\. Residual Plot

This plot displays the prediction errors (residuals) versus the predicted values. The random scatter of points around the zero line indicates that the model is not making any systematic errors, confirming its robust performance.

#### 3\. Feature Importance

This bar chart reveals which features had the most influence on the model's predictions. The height of each bar corresponds to the feature's importance, providing key insights into the factors driving CPU usage.

#### 4\. CPU Usage Distribution

This histogram shows the frequency of different CPU usage values in the dataset. It provides a quick overview of the data's characteristics and distribution.
