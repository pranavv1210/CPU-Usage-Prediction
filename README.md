## CPU Usage Prediction using Machine Learning üíª

### üìù Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict **CPU usage** based on a set of independent variables related to a computing pod's resource requests and runtime. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately forecast CPU consumption, which is critical for resource management and cost optimization in cloud computing environments.

This repository is structured to demonstrate a reproducible machine learning workflow using **Git** for code versioning and **DVC (Data Version Control)** for data and model versioning.

### üìÅ Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following key files:

  * `data-1754297123597.csv`: The raw dataset containing all the features and the target variable (`cpu_usage`).
  * `train_model.py`: The core Python script that handles data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
  * `dvc.yaml`: The DVC pipeline file that defines the entire machine learning workflow.
  * `dvc.lock`: A lock file automatically generated by DVC, which records the exact state of the data and code to ensure reproducibility.
  * `metrics.json`: A file containing the model's performance metrics, saved after training.
  * `model.joblib`: The serialized, trained machine learning model.
  * `.gitignore`: Tells Git to ignore large files and folders (like the `data` and `model` directories) to keep the repository small.
  * `.dvcignore`: Tells DVC to ignore specific files.

### üöÄ Getting Started

To reproduce this project, follow these steps.

#### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have **Git** and **Python** installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

#### **Installation**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pranavv1210/CPU-Usage-Prediction.git
    cd CPU-Usage-Prediction
    ```
2.  Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn dvc joblib
    ```

#### **Running the Experiment**

This project uses a DVC pipeline to ensure the entire workflow is reproducible.

1.  **Initialize DVC:**
    ```bash
    dvc init
    ```
2.  **Restore the Dataset:** Since the dataset is versioned with DVC, you need to pull it from the DVC cache.
    ```bash
    dvc pull
    ```
3.  **Reproduce the Pipeline:** This single command will run the entire experiment‚Äîfrom data processing to model training and evaluation.
    ```bash
    dvc repro
    ```
    This command will execute `train_model.py` and save the trained model and metrics.

### üìä Model Performance

The performance of the trained **Random Forest Regressor** model is logged in `metrics.json`. You can view it directly in your terminal using DVC.

```bash
dvc metrics show
```

The key metrics are:

  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** `0.00069`
  * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** `0.02618`
  * **R-squared ($R^2$):** `0.83211`

The high $R^2$ score indicates that the model is highly effective at explaining the variance in CPU usage.
